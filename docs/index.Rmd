## Participants are the key stakeholders

What's important to them?

--

- Want to get better (72%)
- Help other people (45%)
  - [Williams et al. (2021) JAMA Netw. Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784556)

--

-----

#### Data sharing is the greatest accelerator towards both goals

- Effective treatments are identified only when power is sufficient (i.e. enough data is seen in multifaceted clinical settings)
- Crowdsourcing research questions and analysis increase speed and quality
- Participants are supportive and often expect that data are being shared to maximize benefit to others
  - 93% want their data shared across universities, 82% want it shared with for-profit companies
  - [Mello et al. (2018) NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa1713258)

---
## The data sharing accelerator

- Not incentivized by traditional institutions and funding models
  - i.e. keep your data, get more publications, recycle for more grants

## Why we are *not* here

--

- To make money

## Why we are here

- Help participants get better
- Help other people

#### You are the institutions of the future

--

- YOLO
--

- Put your best ideas in all at once, share everything (**ethically**)
- If your future is scooped by sharing see .orange[\#altac] 
  - (I do **not** think this will happen)
- Good people at NIH (c.f. [Dr. Kraft](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/kraft-peter)) are promoting better practice / tools
  - (i.e. you will have friends in this journey)

## Data management and sharing plans

--
**.orange[Tired]**

--
* "_All_ data will be secured and password protected on an internal machine. Only the PI and research staff will have access. Data will be destroyed at study conclusion."

--
* "Data available upon request"

## Things that used to be hard

**.orange[A recipe for optimal sharing]**

1. Pick a good sharing framework to follow (e.g. FAIR)

2. Know your PHI, plan for de-identification 

3. Follow a common data model whenever possible

4. Write good documentation, share your analytic code (e.g. GitHub)

5. Choose a storage repository
  - Also: create a DOI for your data (e.g. [OSF.io](https://help.osf.io/article/220-create-dois))

6. Encouraged bonus: modify your code in 4. to pull the data from 5.

---
## Frameworks for sharing

[**.orange[FAIR]**](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
1. Findable
  - All data is findable through a persistent identifier and have thorough, searchable metadata
2. Accessible
  - Users can access your data
3. Interoperable
  - Data and metadata use standardized vocabularies and formats (i.e. both humans and machines can read and formats are software agnostic)
4. Reusable
  - Metadata richly describes context under which data was created so users can decide if the data will be _useful_

[OSF](https://osf.io/) (Open Science Framework)

[SEER](https://ies.ed.gov/seer/index.asp) (Standards for Excellence in Education Research)

** Make sure to check your framework against consent and protocol

---
## De-identification $\ne$ anonymization

* De-identification: removal of attributes known to increase the risk of identification (e.g. the [19 PHI elements](https://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/pr_08.asp))

  * Dates of service often the most difficult to handle: retain analytic viability by converting to time since enrollment, assign each patient random shift between 1-365, fancier methods (e.g. [shift and truncate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5070517/))

* Anonymization: irreversible removal of links between the individual and PHI to the degree that it would be virtually impossible to reestablish the link
  * De-identification is a precursor step
  
* In general, de-identification is all that is required to publicly share and to qualify subsequent uses of the data as not human subjects research

---
## Common data models

* Primary benefits: consistent naming allows same analytic scripts to be run across all aligned data sets, metadata and dictionaries are predefined, naming conventions are given to you

-----

* [OMOP](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)
  * Best for EHR/claims data

* [CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/standards) (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium)
  * The regulatory requirement for clinical trials data, e.g. SDTM/ADaM

* [NIH CDE](https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/home) (Common Data Elements repository)
  * Developing, keep your eye on this one!

## Documentation and metadata

## Storage

* [NCI Cancer Data Service](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/cancer-data-service)
  * Includes [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/)
  
* [Gene expression omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)

* [Generalist repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/generalist-repositories) (good for non-genetic data or small biomarker sets)

  * [Figshare](https://figshare.com/); [OSF](https://osf.io/); [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/); [GitHub](https://github.com/)
